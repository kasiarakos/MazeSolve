The maze is read from the "kasiarakos.txt" file.

each square of the maze is represented with an integer.

9 --> is the start.
1 --> is the target.
0 --> the safe position where the robot can move.
4 --> the walls of the maze.

When the program starts it is created the Maze in an array @mazeArray. 
the robot starts to looking for possible position where it can move,
the possible positions are these with values < 2 
each position it follows changes value according the (variable) weight.
Every time that the robot reaches a deadend the according coordinate value
is changes to 3.
the Robot stops the search when it finds the coordinate with value 1.
The path it followed are the coordinates with value greater than 9 with asceding order.

Finally the @sortestSolution method finds the sortest path from the start to the end.
